                Shaniwarwada was constructed in 1732 by the Peshwa Baji Rao I as the seat of the Maratha Empire. The fortification played a crucial role in the administration and military strategies of the Maratha rulers. The fort features impressive gates like the Delhi Gate and the Mastani Gate, and though much of it was destroyed by a fire in 1828, the remaining parts still showcase the grandeur of Maratha architecture. Currently, it's a popular tourist attraction and hosts light and sound shows that narrate the history of the Maratha Empire.
